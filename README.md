Project: Recipes
This is my first HTML project, I expect to use skills that were taught throughout the foundations course. Some of these skills are, the basic workflow of git, boiler plate html, practicing linking images, and working with different fundamental html elements.

After HTML portion of project, I ended up practicing the work flow of git, creating a github repo, and pushing my repo from local to remote servers. I used HTML's <img> element to link local pictures to a webpage, used common HTML list functions (ordered, and unordered). I added developers notes to help future me explain why, or in this case to study or look back on my progress. Worked on practicing adding reader accessibility hopefully it will be burned in as a fundamental in the future. This lesson taught me a lot about using Git, Github, certain features and extensions of vscode, HTML fundamental elements, attributes, and comments.
Thanks The Odin Project!
